# iPet Mobile

Mobile iPet application.

iPet is a web application for veterinary management, time and registration of information relevant to pets. In the future, it will be available for mobile devices using React Native.

The idea is to develop a series of such applications in the future:

- 🐶 iPet (pets management)
- 👨🏻‍⚕️ iVet (management for veterinary centers)
- 🆘 iPet SOS (to report possible cases of animal abuse, disappearances, etc.)
- 🏠 iShelter (management for animal shelters)
